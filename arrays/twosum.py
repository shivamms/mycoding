#Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

#You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

#You can return the answer in any order.
#assumed the array is not sorted
#solution is in haspair.py file
#hints: use hash table and while iterating through the array, check if the complements of current element is in the hash table and if not, add it.
